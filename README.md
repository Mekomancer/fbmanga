FBManga

Created by Mark Z. R.

Fbmanga is a program to view manga on the command line.

Couple things that might explain some ~~bad~~ unique choices.

1. I am coding on a rpi zero 2, for a rpi zero 2.
  - this means I have 416MB of ram
2. I am coding on and for a small screen, 3.5" 320x480 px to be precise
  - although I've tried to stop doing this, 320, 480 and related numbers
    (e.g. 479) pop up occasionaly
  - my screen also is weird because it uses 565 color,
3. I am learning as I go. I learned/am learning how to code by asking questions
   and practice. I have never once taken a CS class, though I probally should.
  - some parts of the code are reused from older projects, that no longer
    exist because I was dumb and fiddled with my file system, breaking it, and
    then I was lazy and only recovered some of it.
  - the git history is crazy...
4. at least half of this code was written past 10pm
